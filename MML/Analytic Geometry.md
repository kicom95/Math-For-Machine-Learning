## 3. Analytic Geometry
* (Page 70)
  * Inner products and their corresponding norms and metrics capture the intuitive notions of *similarity* and *distances*
### 3.1 Norms
* (Page 71)
  * a norm is a function from a real or complex vector space to the nonnegative real numbers that behaves in certain ways like the distance from the origin.
