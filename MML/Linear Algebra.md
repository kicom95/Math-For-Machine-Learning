## 2 Linear Algebra
 * (Page 17)
   * **Linear Algebra** - Study of vectors and certain algebra rules to manipulate vectors.
     * Focuses on the *similarities* between these vector concepts. (Page 18)
 * (Page 17-18)
   * **Vector**
     1. Geometric vectors - intuitions about direction and magnitude
     1. Polynomials
     1. Audio signals
     1. **R^n** (Tuples of n real numbers)
        * Our(This Book's) Focus
        * Closure 
        * Vector Space

### 2.1 Systems of Linear Equations (연립 일차 방정식)
 * **Readings**
   * [System of linear equations from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) 
     * [in Korean](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%97%B0%EB%A6%BD_%EC%9D%BC%EC%B0%A8_%EB%B0%A9%EC%A0%95%EC%8B%9D)
 * (Page 10)
   * for a real-valued system of linear equations we obtain either *no*, *exactly one*, or *infinitely many* solutions.
